# LinkedIn-Analytics-Dashboard-using-excel
I'm excited to share this LinkedIn Analytics Dashboard I created using Excel. It provides insights into my content's performance, follower demographics, and engagement trends.

Some key highlights:
ðŸ“Š Total impressions: 6,351
ðŸ‘¥ Follower count: 571
ðŸ’¡ Top industries: IT Services & Consulting (26%)
ðŸ“ˆ New followers peaked at 39 in January 2025!

This dashboard is a testament to how data analytics can transform raw numbers into actionable insights. By closely monitoring these metrics, I'm able to better understand my audience, optimize my content strategy, and identify new opportunities to grow my LinkedIn presence.
